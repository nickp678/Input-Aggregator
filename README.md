# Input-Aggregator

## Introduction

This is an input aggregating tool that uses selenium to load dynamic websites and aggregates inputs of that website. The user can then use different commands with the data gathered, such as checking the total number of inputs, the urls visited, export the data into a csv file, etc. This tool was created to help web application penetration testers catch inputs they could have missed.

## Prerequisites

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install selenium.

```bash
pip install selenium
```
Download the inputaggreator.py file from github

## Usage

To run the Input Aggregator, use the following command:

```bash
python3 inputaggregator.py
```

From there follow the UI instructions and have fun!
